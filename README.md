# Fine-Grain Vehicle Classification for law enforcement and investigation

The purpose of this project is to develop a system that can take an image of a car and accurately clas-
sify its make, model and release year. This system is intended to support public safety and security
by leveraging technology and deep learning. In situations where law enforcement or other agencies
need to quickly identify a vehicle—such as during investigations or surveillance—an automated,
reliable tool could be highly valuable.
